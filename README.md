# The-Best-Classifier
This repository aims at implementing K Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression algorithms. For each of the algorithms the metrices F1-score, Jaccard Index and Log-Loss are calculated to determine the best classifier among the 4 algorithms
